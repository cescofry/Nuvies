# Nuvies

### TODO:
- Implement a storageController maybe using CoreData so data persists towards sessions
- The XMLParser used on the first VC is probabbly on the main thread. Meaning that it's locking the UI. 
- Movies.h represents a single movie. Maybe it should be called Movie.h
- You probabbly don't need to implement all of these, however make sure you have a README file where you explain everything you would have done if this was more than a test.
